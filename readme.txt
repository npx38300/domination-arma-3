!!!!!!!!!BESIDE THE NORMAL license.txt FILE READ ALSO THE license_additional.txt FILE!!!!!!!!!!!!

While some things may basically be and look the same, all scripts were touched and a lot of code has changed.
Additionally the TT version does no longer exist and all TT code was removed. Also all code regarding custom made third party content was removed (for example ACRE).

I have no idea if headless client support still works as I'm unable to test it locally in LAN mode.
(One is unable to connect a local HC to a local dedi server since july 2013, connecting with two or more local normal game clients works perfectly just not a HC).

First Dom 3 release is 3.00
